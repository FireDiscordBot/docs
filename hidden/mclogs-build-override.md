# Uh oh!

The easy method of opting out isn't available just yet as it requires a couple backend changes that will be done later today!

For now, you can opt out by [joining the Fire Discord server](https://inv.wtf/fire) and opening a ticket using the `/new` command in #bot-commands

Make sure you state that you would like to opt out in the ticket and please do not leave the server before receiving confirmation that your request has been processed!
