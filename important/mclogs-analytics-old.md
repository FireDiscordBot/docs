# Preface

This document outlines upcoming changes to the Minecraft log parsing feature found in some servers with Fire. This is a private feature that scans logs uploaded/sent in channels and provides possible solutions for issues and recommendations.

# What is changing?

This change adds some data collection to this feature for use by the developer of Fire and a couple others \(the same people who add the solutions & recommendations\) to improve this feature. The data collected is outlined further down the page

# Can I opt out?

Yes! I made sure to keep users who'd rather not have data collected that isn't necessary to provide functionality in mind.

You can opt out by sending an email to `mclogs@gaminggeek.dev` with the subject `DATA COLLECTION OPT OUT` and provide your [user id](https://dis.gd/findmyid) in the body OR you can join the [Fire Discord](https://inv.wtf/fire) and create a ticket using `/new` in the #bot-commands channel

The latter is the easiest and you will be given feedback when your opt out has been processed whereas via email you may not

# What data is collected?

* Your Discord user id \(used for gathering your data package and data deletion if requested as outlined in the privacy policy\)
* Name of the Discord server where the log was sent
* The regular and raw haste links for the log
* The possible solutions & recommendations that you were given
* Cheats found
* The method used to send the log
* Minecraft IGN if it is found to be invalid

# How does this data help?

This data can & will be used in a few different ways but mainly to figure out if solutions, recommendations etc. are being falsely triggered & finding new solutions, recommendations etc. to add to the system

# When did this start??? Do you already have some of my data?!??!???

As of writing this, it hasn't. Servers with this feature enabled will be instructed to inform users of this change before it comes into effect and place a notice somewhere prominent \(e.g. in server rules\) for new users. Servers that are found to not be following this may have their access to the feature revoked and reports of non-compliance can be sent to `mclogs@gaminggeek.dev` with the [server's id](https://dis.gd/findmyid) in the body, preferrably with evidence too to speed up any necessary actions.

It is planned to come into effect on the ~~8th~~ 18th of December so if you wish to opt out, please do so before this date.

Your continued use of the Service after the ~~8th~~ 18th of December will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to these changes. If you object to the changes, you shall request to opt out as outlined above before that date to prevent unwanted data collection.
