## Introduction and accepting the terms

These Terms of Service (“Terms”), which include and hereby incorporate the [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) (“Privacy Policy”), are a legal agreement between Fire ("we", "us", "our") and you ("you" or “your”). By using our services, you agree that you are 13 years of age or older and agree to the terms outlined within this document.

We may, at any time, and at our sole discretion, update or modify this document without prior notice (although an announcement will usually be made in [our Discord](https://inv.wtf/fire)), which we may do for reasons that include, but are not limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting changes to our services. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, your continued use of the Service after we post modifications will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to those changes. If you object to the changes, you shall stop using our services and can request data removal as outlined in the Privacy Policy.\

## Rights to use our services

By using any of our services you agree to follow the following conditions without any objections, except with prior written permission by us.

You _may_ be given one warning if you don't adhere to these conditions. We reserve the right to revoke or block access to any service at any time if you don't adhere to these conditions, violate our Terms of Service in any way, or for whatever reason we deem valid without justification.

## Essential conditions

The key words "MUST NOT", "SHALL NOT", "MAY" in all of the following portions of this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

- You SHALL NOT attempt to abuse, exploit or misuse these services in any way.
- You SHALL NOT exceed our rate limits for a substantial amount of time. Actions like this are taken very seriously and may even be reported to local authorities if necessary.

## Restrictions

Along with the above terms for Fire's web-facing services, we reserve the right to block any request sent to these services at any time and for any reason. You should use a custom User-Agent if automating requests to allow us to identify you. Most common default User-Agent's ("Java/1.8.0", "aiohttp/3.6.2" etc.) have been blocked from accessing our services to prevent malicious automated actions. If you find yourself being blocked by Cloudflare, please ensure you are using a custom User-Agent. If you are still blocked and cannot figure out how to resolve it, please email [cf@gaminggeek.dev](mailto:cf@gaminggeek.dev) quoting the RAY ID from the page.

## Use of third-party services

Use of a third-party service in any service we provide does not indicate endorsement of said services nor do we take responsibility for the actions taken by these third-party services. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage as a result of interactions with these services.

## Branding

Fire's branding (e.g. our logo, with or without the "Fire" name) MUST NOT be used in a way that is harmful to the brand, such as attempting to deceive a user and attempt to cause any harm to another user or any other malicious intent.
