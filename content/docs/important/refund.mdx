## Am I eligible for a refund?

When purchasing Fire+ for the first time, you will be given a 3 day free trial. This trial is your opportunity to see what Fire+ is all about and figure out whether you like it or not.

<Callout type="info">
  Additional servers cannot be added during a trial! Updating your plan will
  result in an immediate charge if you're still in your trial period.
</Callout>

If you decide you don't like it, you can head over to the plus page on the [Fire website](https://getfire.bot) where you originally purchased Fire+ and click the `Manage Subscription` button to head on over to Stripe where you can cancel your subscription. We ask that you do this as soon as possible to avoid any unnecessary charges but refunds will be given, no questions asked, within the first 7 days after your trial ends.

If you have previously purchased plus and were not eligible for a trial, you can get a refund, no questions asked, within the first 7 days of starting your subscription or within the first 14 days if no plus features were used.

<Callout type="warn">
  Usage checks for plus features apply to any server you have given plus to for
  the duration of your subscription and include features enabled in past
  subscriptions! If you had previously enabled a feature during a past
  subscription, any usage of that feature by server members will limit you to 7
  days for a no questions asked refund
</Callout>

Refunds will also be available, no questions asked, for 7 days after each invoice is paid. You can see which date your next invoice is on the [Fire website](https://getfire.bot/dashboard/plus).

## Claiming a refund

If you are eligible for a refund in line with the terms above, you can request it by making a ticket in the [Fire Discord](https://inv.wtf/fire) with the `/new` command in the #bot-commands channel. Additional verification may be required, such as confirming the email linked to the account, the last 4 digits of your card

If you're unable to create a ticket, you can also send an email to `refunds@getfire.bot` from the same email linked to your Discord account to request a refund.

In the cases where you are not eligible for a refund, you may be eligible for a discount code that you can use if you wish to resubscribe or give to a friend by letting us know why you're unsubscribing by making a ticket in the Fire discord.

## Any questions?

If you have any questions about plus refunds, you can send an email to `refunds@getfire.bot` or you can make a ticket in the [Fire Discord](https://inv.wtf/fire).
