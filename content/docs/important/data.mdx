## Analytics Folder

This folder contains any data from Fire's InfluxDB database, used for debugging and insight into Fire's usage. This data is not shared with anyone unless otherwise specified.

### discord_oauth.json

Any time you authorize with Fire via OAuth, a bit of information about it will be logged by Fire via the [Application Authorized](https://discord.com/developers/docs/events/webhook-events#application-authorized) event

Currently, information logged includes the time, your username & user id, scopes you authorized, the server (if applicable), Fire's permissions (if applicable) and the type of integration (if applicable)

### commands.json

This contains a log of the commands you have ran including the time, command name, errors, server, message/interaction id, permissions and more.

### interactions.json

Similar to the commands log, this is a log of all your interactions with Fire (slash commands, context menus, buttons etc.)

### minecraft_logs.json

This contains the data collected via the Minecraft Log Scanning feature. You can learn more about this [here](../notices/Minecraft%20Logs%20Analytics).

This data is shared with some users who were given access to the log scanning feature before it was available as a plus perk to help learn about its usage and to improve the feature.
