# Statement from Fire's developer, Jake Ward (a.k.a Geek)

It's been heartbreaking seeing what's been going on in Los Angeles with wildfires destroying tens of thousands of acres throughout the greater LA area, displacing over 150,000 residents alongside the unfortunate news that it has taken the lives of 16 people so far. The photos & videos coming from LA are truly upsetting and I cannot imagine how those affected must be feeling right now.

If you are in the Los Angeles area, I hope you're able to stay safe with all that's going on. Always make sure to listen to local authorities and reputable news sources so you're up to date. If you've got elderly/vulnerable neighbors, check in on them to make sure they are doing okay and have everything they need.

If you're still at home but are near the fires, I strongly recommend making sure you have a [go-bag](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-08/a-fire-is-forcing-you-to-evacuate-what-do-you-pack) packed and ready to go if an evacuation order is issued for your area so you and anyone else living with you (including pets!) can leave as soon as possible if needed.

I knew I couldn't just sit here, nice & comfortable in my home, doing absolutely nothing while all of this was happening so I have decided to "fight fire with Fire"

# How Fire is helping

As of today, Fire has donated $200 (plus covering transaction fees where possible) to the following 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations:

- [Watch Duty](https://www.watchduty.org/), a website & app providing real-time alerts for nearby wildfires and firefighting efforts. I chose to donate to them as I've seen so many people in my social media feeds prasing it for its usefulness and recommending it to others so they can stay alert and safe. You can donate to them [here](https://app.watchduty.org/donate)

- [World Central Kitchen](https://wck.org/), an organization that has done incredible work in response to tragidies around the world and is continuing to do so by distributing free meals to first responders and members of the public at several locations across SoCal. You can read more about [their response to the wildfires](https://wck.org/relief/california-fires-jan25) and can donate to support their wildfire relief efforts [here](https://donate.wck.org/give/654000#!/donation/checkout)

- [Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation](https://supportlafd.org/), supporting LAFD members risking their lives to battle the wildfires by providing tools & supplies. You can donate to their Wildfire Emergency Funding Alert [here](https://supportlafd.kindful.com/?campaign=1040812)

- [California Fire Foundation](https://www.cafirefoundation.org/), providing support to firefighters, families of fallen firefighters and the communities they protect in the form of emotional & financial assistance. The California Fire Foundation is working with local fire agencies and community-based organizations to provide direct financial support to impacted residents as details of the damage emerge. You can donate to support their wildfire & distaster relief efforts [here](https://cpf.salsalabs.org/disasterrelief/index.html)

The donations were split evenly across all four organizations (i.e. $50 each)

If you're in a position to do so, we strongly recommend donating to these organisations or [others listed here](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/help-victims-california-wildfires-affecting-los-angeles-county/)
